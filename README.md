# Self-made drone
This is my almost fully diy drone. At first i made only an fc, but in the end i also made an esc too. It supports betaflight, analog, digital video systems, all types of recievers. Basicly it can do what the commercial ones can.


## PCB
### FC
Its a four layered pcb with double sided component placement. Most likely not the best way to make it, but this is what i can do.

###ESC
It also has 4 layers and also on both sides are components. I made it a little wierd becouse i only could make the two sides basicly mirrored.

## Firmware
For the esc i have to upload a bootloader and then the frimware trough st link. The fc's i only have to upload from the betaflight software, so its not so difficult.

## Prodiction
Sadly the PCBA is REALLY expensive, so i have to solder it together myself. It will be a little difficult, but i will try. The other component will be easier i think.
